# Singularityhub Library API Standard Community Charter

The Singularityhub Library API Standard Community is made up of people who
are interested in the specification for the Library API.
Standards usually evolve, so this charter describes the process for
making that happen.
The community's intention is to evolve the standard in compatible ways
so older implementations can continue to work.

## Approving changes

In order to avoid letting the specification be controlled by a single
individual or company, changes to the specification and to this charter
are reviewed by a set of people designated as "Maintainers."
There are 3 to 5 Maintainers, each from separate organizations.
Maintainers are "members" in the 
[github repository](https://github.com/singularityhub/library-api)
so they can use GitHub tools to mark pull requests as "Approved" or
"Changes requested."
Discussions will be public in issues or pull requests in that repository.
Maintainers will watch the GitHub repository for all activity.
Every effort will be made to achieve a consensus among the Maintainers,
but if consensus cannot be reached, changes can still be accepted if a
majority of the Maintainers agree.

## Adding Maintainers

If there are less than the maximum number of Maintainers and someone else volunteers,
as long as the new person is from a different organization,
a new approver can be added when a majority of the existing Approvers agree.

## Removing Maintainers

People can be removed from the current list of Maintainers if they request to be removed.

In addition, an Maintainer can be removed if for some reason the Maintainer stops
responding for a period of 2 months or more,
and the remaining Maintainers all agree.

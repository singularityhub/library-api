# Singularityhub Library API Standard Community Charter

The Singularityhub Library API Standard Community is made up of people who
are interested in the specification for the Library API.
Standards usually evolve, so this charter describes the process for
making that happen.
The community's intention is to evolve the standard in compatible ways
so older implementations can continue to work.

## Approving changes

In order to avoid letting the specification be controlled by a single
individual or company, changes to the specification and to this charter
are reviewed by a set of people designated as "Approvers".
There are 3 to 5 Approvers, each from separate organizations.
Approvers are "members" in the 
[github repository](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-api)
so they can use github tools to mark pull requests as "Approved" or
"Changes requested".
Discussions will be public in issues or pull requests in that repository.
Approvers will "Watch" the github repository for all activity.
Every effort will be made to achieve a consensus among the Approvers,
but if consensus cannot be reached, changes can still be accepted if a
majority of the Approvers agree.

## Adding Approvers

If there are less than the maximum number of Approvers and someone else volunteers,
as long as the new person is from a different organization,
a new approver can be added when a majority of the existing Approvers agree.

## Removing Approvers

People can be removed from the current list of Approvers if they request to be removed.

In addition, an Approver can be removed if for some reason the Approver stops
responding for a period of 2 weeks or more,
and the remaining Approvers all agree.
